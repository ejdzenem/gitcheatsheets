Within a single repository, I can store different versions of the project. These in-repository changes are tracked via branches. To switch from my current branch to another one, I will check out the branch I want to switch to. (In my head I say, “This is really cool! Check! It! Out!”) Before switching, Git will force me to deal with the uncommitted changes by either committing them, stashing them, or discarding them. The commit process will permanently store my changes to the repository, whereas stash will temporarily shelve the changes, allowing me to pull them off the shelf and reapply them later.
