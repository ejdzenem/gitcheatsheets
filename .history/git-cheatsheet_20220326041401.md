### GIT INIT

`git init`

Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no
arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.

`git commit -m <commit message>`

Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit
combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message.

`git clone <repo>`

Clone repo located at `<repo>` onto local machine. Original repo can be
located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.

```
git rebase <base>
```

Rebase the current branch onto `<base>`. `<base>` can be a commit ID,
branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD.

### GIT CONFIG
`git config`

Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs
commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.

GIT REFLOG
`git reflog`

Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD.
Add --relative-date flag to show date info or --all to show all refs.

`git add`

Stage all changes in `<directory>` for the next commit.
Replace `<directory>` with a `<file>` to change a specific file.

## GIT BRANCHES

`git commit -m "<message>"`

Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching
a text editor, use `<message>` as the commit message.

`git branch`

`git status`

List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.

`git checkout -b <branch>`

Create and check out a new branch named `<branch>`.
Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch.

`git log`

Display the entire commit history using the default format.
For customization see additional options.

`git merge <branch>`

Merge `<branch>` into the current branch.

`git diff`

Show unstaged changes between your index and
working directory.

REMOTE REPOSITORIES

`<directory>`

user.name `<name>`

`<directory>`

List all of the branches in your repo. Add a `<branch>` argument to
create a new branch with the name `<branch>`.

`git remote add`

Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote,
you can use `<name>` as a shortcut for `<url>` in other commands.

`git fetch <remote> <branch>`

Fetches a specific `<branch>`, from the repo. Leave off `<branch>`
to fetch all remote refs.

`git pull <remote>`

Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and
immediately merge it into the local copy.

`<name>` `<url>`

UNDOING CHANGES

`<commit>`

Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in
`<commit>`, then apply it to the current branch.

`git reset <file>`

Remove `<file>` from the staging area, but leave the working directory
unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes.

`git clean -n`

Shows which files would be removed from working directory.
Use the `-f` flag in place of the `-n` flag to execute the clean.

`git revert`

`--amend`

`git push <remote> <branch>`

Push the branch to `<remote>`, along with necessary commits and
objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist.

`git diff --cached`

Show difference between staged changes and last commit

### GIT RESET

`git reset`

Reset staging area to match most recent commit,
but leave the working directory unchanged.

`git config --system`

Set text editor used by commands for all users on the machine. `<editor>`
arg should be the command that launches the desired editor (e.g., vi).

`git reset --hard`

Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent
commit and overwrites all changes in the working directory.

`git config`

Open the global configuration file in a text editor for manual editing.

`git reset <commit>`

Move the current branch tip backward to `<commit>`, reset the
staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone.

core.editor `<editor>`

--global --edit

`git reset --hard`
`<commit>`

### GIT LOG

`git log -<limit>`

E.g. `git log -5` will limit to 5 commits.

`git log --oneline`

Condense each commit to a single line.

`git log -p`

Display the full diff of each commit.

`git log --stat`

Include which files were altered and the relative number of
lines that were added or deleted from each of them.

GIT PULL

`git log --author=`

`git pull --rebase`

`git log`
Search for commits with a commit message that
matches `<pattern>`.

GIT PUSH

`git log <since>..<until>`

Show commits that occur between `<since>` and `<until>`. Args can be a
commit ID, branch name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference.

`git log -- <file>`

`git log --graph "<pattern> --grep=”<pattern>” --decorate"`

Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to
match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after `<commit>`.

### GIT REBASE

Interactively rebase current branch onto `<base>`. Launches editor to enter
commands for how each commit will be transferred to the new base.

`git rebase -i <base> <remote>`

Fetch the remote’s copy of current branch and rebases it into the local
copy. Uses git rebase instead of merge to integrate the branches.

`--force`
Forces the git push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use
the --force flag unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing.

Only display commits that have the specified file.

`git push <remote>`

Push all of your local branches to the specified remote.

--graph flag draws a text based graph of commits on left side of commit

`git push <remote>`

msgs. --decorate adds names of branches or tags of commits shown.

`git push <remote>`

`--all`

`--tags`

Tags aren’t automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the
`--all` flag. The `--tags` flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo.
