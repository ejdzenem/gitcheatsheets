Within a single repository
=============================

I can store different versions of the project.  
These in-repository changes are tracked via _branches_.  
To switch from my current branch to another one, I will _check out_ the branch I want to switch to.
Before switching, Git will force me to deal with the uncommitted changes by either _committing_ them, _stashing_ them, or discarding them.  
The _commit_ process will **permanently store my changes** to the repository, whereas _stash_ will **temporarily shelve the changes**, allowing me to pull them off the shelf and reapply them later.
